###Block - Artificer Class Features
MAGICAL TINKERING		DESC:At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have tinker's tools or other artisan's tools  in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 fe et. • Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a re­corded message  that  can be heard up to  10 fe et away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. • The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to  10 feet away. • A static visual effect appears on  one  of the object's sur­faces.  This effect can be a picture, up to  25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this fe ature, though a single  object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this fe ature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your max­imum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies. 


SPELLCASTING		DESC:You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or out­landish inventions. TOOLS REQUIRED You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5,  "Equipment," in  the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus. 
CANTRIPS			DESC:(0-LEVEL SPELLS) At 1st level, you know two can trips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list. 
PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS	DESC:The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are avail­able for you to  cast,  choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an In­telligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a  1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting fo­cuses: at least 1  minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

RITUAL CASTING You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
